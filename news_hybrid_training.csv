Read our Privacy notice Keir Starmer has backed Wes Streeting and refuted the “completely unacceptable” Number 10 leaks amid mounting speculation the prime minister could face a leadership coup. The prime minister’s allies have accused the health secretary and home secretary Shabana Mahmood of being on leadership manoeuvres. Mr Streeting hit back at the rumours that he is planning a leadership challenge , describing them as “self-defeating and self-destructive” , and comparing them to conspiracy theories. His comments follow a flurry of late-night briefings from Number 10 in which allies of the prime minister came out fighting on his behalf amid fears his job could be under threat after the Budget in two weeks’ time. Mr Streeting told Sky News the briefings show there needs to be a change in “culture” in the Labour Party. He added: “I do think that trying to kneecap one of your own team when they are out, not just making the case for the government, but actually delivering the change that we promised, I think that is also self-defeating and self-destructive behaviour.” Sir Keir Starmer said attacks on any of his cabinet members is “completely unacceptable”, after briefings against Health Secretary Wes Streeting. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch had asked if Mr Streeting was right when he said there was a “toxic culture in Downing Street that needs to change”. Sir Keir replied: “My focus each and every day is on rebuilding and renewing our country. But let me be absolutely clear, any attack on any member of my cabinet is completely unacceptable.” He said Mr Streeting had out-performed expectations by delivering five million extra appointments within the first year of a Labour government, higher than the two million pledged. “He’s doing a great job, as is the whole of my Cabinet,” Sir Keir said. The Independent’s political editor David Maddox reports: A furious senior Labour backbencher has messaged to express fury over the “epic own goal” by Downing Street. They said: “What a shambles and own goal from no 10, they’ve literally created a story that wasn’t needed and has backfired spectacularly, even those that weren’t Wes Streeting fans are now thinking what the Hell!” “This is hugely embarrassing for no 10 but a huge win for Wes. It’s an Epic own goal!” The Independent’s political correspondent Caitlin Doherty reports: The prime minister did not take the chance to say he has full confidence in his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. Asked the question by Tory leader Kemi Badenoch at PMQs, Sir Keir said: ""Morgan McSweeney, my team and I are absolutely focussed on delivering for the country. ""And let me be clear, of course I've never authorised attacks on Cabinet members, I appointed them to their posts because they're the best people to carry out their jobs."" He also mentioned various Labour policy points on the NHS. Mrs Badenoch said: ""I didn't hear him give full confidence to Morgan McSweeney."" Kemi Badenoch has said the government has “descended into civil war”. During PMQs, the Conservative leader said: “Two weeks before the Budget the government has descended into civil war instead of fixing the mess made of the government.” In reference to the briefings Downing Street gave overnight, she added: “These are feral MPs No 10 has been talking about – they’re not my words, they’re No 10’s words.” Keir Starmer has backed Wes Streeting amid rumours the health secretary is mounting a leadership coup. The prime minister told the Commons during PMQs that Mr Streeting “is doing a great job”, adding, “as is the rest of my cabinet”. The Independent’s political editor David Maddox reports: The Tory leader wasted no time in going after the prime minister and the “toxic culture” in Downing Street. The language was taken from the morning broadcast round interviews by health secretary Wes Streeting who called for people in Downing Street to be sacked after he was briefed against last night. The second question put the focus on Morgan McSweeney, the controversial chief of staff in Downing Street who many are now blaming for this briefing which has plunged the government into crisis. Sir Keir’s defence of McSweeney was not fulsome and his claims he has “a united team” was met with laughter. This is proving to be an easy PMQs outing for Ms Badenoch.

This is proving to be an easy PMQs outing for Ms Badenoch. The Independent’s political correspondent Caitlin Doherty reports: Sir Keir Starmer has faced the first jibe about the leadership crisis that engulfed Number 10 on Tuesday evening. Conservative MP Lincoln Jopp associated himself with the PM's comments marking Armistice Day at PMQs, and said: ""I particularly remember in 1997 in west Africa where I somehow managed to survive a bloody and violent attempted coup. ""So if the prime minister wants and ideas about how to do that he only has to ask."" The Independent’s political editor David Maddox reports: A former senior Tory adviser to a prime minister has expressed astonishment that Labour MPs seem to be following the example of their party in wanting to depose leaders. They said: “The biggest difference between Labour and us is that it took us almost 14 years to get to this circular firing squad. “Labour have got there in 18 months and somehow managed to skip doing any of the good bits on the way.” The Independent’s political editor David Maddox reports: Professor Sir John Curtice, the leading pollster, has warned that if Labour follows the example of the Tories and deposes an unpopular leader to save themselves then they need to do it better than the Tories did. Asked if ditching Sir Keir Starmer would work for Labour, he said: “Depends on how it is done and the quality of the replacement. The Tories did not choose well!” When Theresa May was deposed the Tories picked Boris Johnson who himself was then forced out and replaced by Liz Truss. But she only survived 49 days after her disastrous mini Budget and her replacement Rishi Sunak was unable to rescue the party from record defeat.

Read our Privacy notice Over 35,000 people have backed a petition calling for the BBC to rule out compensating Donald Trump as his legal threat looms. The petition says that any financial payment to Trump would be “inappropriate and against the ethos of public service broadcasting,” and demands that any compensation paid should be refunded to TV licence payers. It says: “Such an action would mean using public funds for purposes that many licence payers might find objectionable and unrepresentative of their values. The US president has said he has an “obligation” to sue the BBC over the way his “beautiful speech” on 6 January 2021 was edited. Speaking for the first time since his lawyers took the unprecedented step of threatening to sue the corporation for $1bn, he told Fox News: ""They actually changed my January 6 speech, which was a beautiful speech, which was a very calming speech, and they made it sound radical.” He claimed the BBC ""defrauded the public"", adding: “I think I have an obligation to [sue them], you can’t allow people to do that.” The acting head of BBC News is set to address staff today, according to reports. Jonathan Munro, who is currently the deputy head of news, will be taking charge of the news operation after CEO Deborah Turness announced she will be stepping down. Turness has not yet officially left the job as of yet, but in a call yesterday Tim Davie said Munro would be leading news for at least a few days. Abortion rights campaigners have criticised Michael Prescott’s memo for labelling the term “reproductive rights” as “contested. In the former BBC adviser’s leaked memo, he wrote that the BBC “focused too heavily” on Harris campaign issues such as abortion and women’s rights. He wrote the BBC sometimes “fell into using, without attribution, contested language such as ‘ reproductive rights ’”, adding he thought this signalled to viewers a “biased mindset”. Kerry Abel, chair of Abortion Rights, said she was “shocked” to see the term - which is recognised by the UN - was labelled “contested”. “Labelling it ‘contested’ risks obscuring the reality of the issues at stake and undermines trust in accurate, rights-based reporting,” she said. While speaking to staff on a call on Tuesday morning, outgoing director general Tim Davie gave three key reasons for his departure. BBC News reported he said the relentlessness of the role, the upcoming Charter renewal and criticism of the Panorama documentary on Trump were all contributing factors. The majority of Britons believe the BBC should apologise to Donald Trump over the editing of his speech in a panorama documentary. A new YouGov poll found 57 per cent of respondents believed the BBC should apologise, while 25 per cent believed they shouldn’t and 18 percent didn’t know. 90 per cent of Reform voters believed the BBC should apologise, compared to 75 per cent of Conservatives, 55 per cent of Lib Dems and 51 per cent of Labour voters. Only 35 per cent of 18-25 year olds believed the broadcaster should say sorry, compared to 70 per cent of people aged over 65. As he said he had an “obligation” to sue the BBC, Donald Trump characterised his January 6 2021 speech as “very calming” and “beautiful”. ""They actually changed my January 6 speech, which was a beautiful speech, which was a very calming speech, and they made it sound radical,"" Trump told Fox News. ""They showed me the results of how they butchered it up. It was very dishonest and the head man quit and a lot of the other people quit."" Trump delivered his speech before his supporters stormed the US Capitol. Though he did tell the crowd to march “peacefully and patriotically”, he later told them to “fight like hell”. BBC staffers and leading political figures are calling for Sir Robbie Gibb to step down from the BBC board. So, who is the Tory ‘agent’ at the centre of a tangled web of politics and media interests, asks Katie Rosseinsky: Over 35,000 people have backed a petition calling for the BBC to rule out compensating Donald Trump as his legal challenge looms. The petition, on Change.org, says it would be “inappropriate and against the ethos of public service broadcasting,” and states that if any compensation were paid, an equivalent refund should be made to TV licence payers. It says: “This would serve not only as a gesture of goodwill but also as a reassurance to the public that their money will not be used for questionable financial settlements.” Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said the crisis at the BBC has provided an “opportunity” to “take away all the people who were political appointees”. Ms Cooper told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme: “We Liberal Democrats don’t think that there should be any political appointees and we would like to see legislation to bring back the independent appointments process for the BBC board.” The St Albans MP added: “I do think that this crisis in the BBC provides an opportunity for us to clear up the BBC and to make sure we can safeguard its independence for future. “When you look at independent editorial decisions that have been made on particular stories, there’s no doubt in my mind that the BBC has, on a number of occasions, been pretty sloppy, and it’s been very slow at correcting them. “But I think ultimately this is an opportunity, this crisis, and the way we make the most of that, to protect the BBC, to safeguard its future and to protect its independence, is to make sure that we can take away all the people who were political appointees.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",2025-11-12 11:54:15,5786,independent.co.uk,en
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/bristol-grooming-gang-arrests-b2863553.html,Seven men charged with sex crimes in Bristol grooming gang investigation,"They are charged with more than 40 offences against 11 teenage victims I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Seven men have been charged after an investigation into group-based child sexual exploitation in Bristol. The men have cumulatively been charged with more than 40 offences against 11 teenage victims . Avon and Somerset Police said the offences date from between 2022 and 2025. The men were all rearrested on Tuesday in a police operation in Bristol and are due to appear at Bristol Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday morning. “It follows an investigation which began in November 2023 after concerns were raised about the sexual exploitation of a teenage girl,” Avon and Somerset Police said. “In April 2024, initial arrests were made as part of a day of action in the city. Those arrested were released on bail to allow enquiries to take place, with a dedicated team working to identify and investigate offences.” The alleged victims were in their mid to late teens when the alleged offences occurred, police said. Syrian national Mohamed Arafe, 19, of Speedwell in Bristol, has been charged with five counts of arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child, one count of causing or inciting the sexual exploitation of a child, one count of sexual assault, one count of being concerned in the supply of cocaine and a further count of being concerned in the supply of ecstasy. Iranian national Sina Omari, 20, of Fishponds in Bristol, has been charged with two counts of rape, four counts of arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child, one count of causing or inciting the sexual exploitation of a child, two counts of making an indecent photograph of a child, one count of being concerned in the supply of cocaine and a further count of being concerned in the supply of ecstasy. Syrian national Wadie Sharaf, 21, of Redland in Bristol, has been charged with one count of rape, one count of attempted rape, three counts of sexual assault, and a further count of sexual activity with a child. British national Hussain Bashar, 19, of Southmead in Bristol, has been charged with one count of rape. British national Mohammed Kurdi, 21, of Henbury in Bristol, has been charged with two counts of rape, two counts of arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child, one count of supplying a class-A drug (ecstasy) and a further count of supplying a class-B drug (cannabis). A 19-year-old man, who police are unable to name for legal reasons, has been charged with four counts of rape, one count of arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child, one count of distributing an indecent photograph of a child, one count of being concerned in the supply of cocaine and a further count of being concerned in the supply of ecstasy. A 26-year-old man, who police are unable to name for legal reasons, has been charged with two counts of rape and one count of sexual assault. Detective chief inspector Tom Herbert, the senior investigating officer, said: “This remains a complex and sensitive investigation which has the protection of young girls from exploitation and the disruption of offending at its very heart. “Working with our partners, we’ve ensured the most appropriate safeguarding measures and support has been made available to each victim to protect them from harm. “Officers have been working around the clock to identify potential offences and we’ve worked extremely closely with the CPS to reach this highly significant stage.”",2025-11-12 11:53:27,3562,independent.co.uk,en

https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202511/12/WS6913cd70a310fc20369a4852.html,China's micro-dramas a screen saver for film world,"When he was growing up, Galim Gaisin wanted to be an actor — a dream he has today realized not on large cinema screens, but in short serial dramas played out on smartphones. After featuring in a commercial for earphones four years ago, the career of the 27-year-old Canadian, who lives in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, has taken off. Most of his success can be attributed to the China-birthed cultural phenomenon of micro-dramas, the short 1- to 2-minute films made for vertical viewing on social media devices. Of Canadian-Russian heritage, Gaisin studied cinematography at a top university in Moscow, but failed to get a foothold in the industry there. In 2018, he first came to China as an exchange student and decided to move to China the next year. The earphone commercial and a number of roles in movies and TV shows helped him reconnect with the film industry. However, it was Gaisin's involvement over the past two years in micro-dramas — some of which have reached beyond the Chinese market — that has solidified his career. In early October, at O.M Studio's production base in Shanghai, Gaisin filmed a new micro-drama aimed at the North American market. The male lead in that production, Gaisin estimated the total number of micro-dramas he has done so far is around 30 — including Chinese and English ones. ""The Chinese micro-drama market is developing so rapidly and growing so big, and the whole production process is much more developed. It is quite an experience to film short dramas in China. It is much more like a real movie set, where there is a huge crew and everybody knows what they are doing,"" said Gaisin, describing the Shanghai film crew as a precise and efficient ""machine"". He said he enjoys the freedom of filming micro-dramas, which is different from movies and TV series. There is less pressure on the actors who have more leeway to be creative. ""It is much more loose in a good way,"" Gaisin said. ""Directors of short dramas are more open to new ideas. They give actors the space to bring some personal characteristics to the role, which I think is important for actors to improve themselves. ""Sometimes I feel short dramas embrace your inner child, as you can forget it's work and feel it's more like a game,"" he added with a smile. Gaisin is not the only overseas performer starring in micro-dramas. Ashlynn Judy, 25, flew from Los Angeles, California, to Shanghai for the filming, marking her first trip to China. Although she has a degree in film studies, back home she was not able to get enough opportunities in the industry and had to work as a waitress. She got her first role in short dramas in April, and more roles followed. About three months ago, she quit her waitressing job and started doing short dramas full-time. ""I never thought I'd get to come to Shanghai and it's amazing. Getting to act and work on set full-time has been so wonderful and what I've wanted to do for so long. It's definitely a plus to get to visit a new city and experience new cultures and meet the people,"" she said excitedly. ""It's been a life-changing experience for me — busy, fun and really great,"" she added.",,3134,chinadaily.com.cn,en
https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202511/12/WS6913da2aa310fc20369a48a1.html,Calls and conservation,"Despite the patchy rain and persistent mist, 45 keen bird-watchers, draped in raincoats, cameras, lenses and binoculars, set off into the wilds of the Lancang Lahu autonomous county in Southwest China's Yunnan province on Nov 1. Their task, split into 12 teams, was to document as many bird species within the area within 60 hours. This, the second Yunnan Lancang Bird-watching Festival, held within the city of Pu'er, would yield some impressive results. Almost three days later, when the teams emerged from the wilderness, a record 273 bird species had been identified, including seven species that had never been recorded in the area before, such as the elusive spotwinged starling. The Yunnan Lancang Bird-watching Festival falls under the auspices of the ""Our Yunnan"" project, an endeavor launched in 2023 to fill data gaps in local wildlife, enhance conservation efforts and explore sustainable forest resource management practices that benefit local communities while protecting biodiversity. This collaborative effort between governmental bodies, nongovernment organizations and corporate sponsors involves rigorous, field-based surveys to create an accurate snapshot of local wildlife populations. Lu Wen, director of the Nuozhadu Provincial Nature Reserve in Pu'er, which extends into part of Lancang, said both iterations of the bird race so far have added new species to the area's list. ""Pu'er's existing bird checklist contains around 470 species,"" Lu said. ""Prior to 2023, the reserve's own record stood at 233 species. The first Lancang bird race in 2023 had added 47 species to our checklist."" Lei Jinyu, secretary-general of the Rosefinch Center, a nonprofit dedicated to bird-watching and a key implementer of the ""Our Lancang"" project, told China Daily: ""In less than three days, we documented more than half the bird species known to inhabit Pu'er and a significant portion of those found within the Nuozhadu reserve. This clearly shows that organizing a bird race is an exceptionally quick and effective method for conducting bird surveys."" Since the ""Our Lancang"" project's launch in 2022, supported by the Lancang county government, Huatai Futures Co and the Huatai Foundation, the initiative has concentrated on biodiversity monitoring in the area. Speaking of the project, Pang Tao, project coordinator from the Shan Shui Conservation Center's Yunnan office, said it aims to fill data gaps and enhance wildlife surveys, providing scientific guidance for future conservation efforts. The Chinese NGO is dedicated to species and ecosystem conservation and addressing human-nature coexistence issues, and it manages the ""Our Lancang"" project. The project also investigates sustainable forest resource management and biodiversity conservation practices, benefiting local communities and paving the way for ecotourism development, Pang added. ""We have installed 23 infrared cameras at various sites in Lancang to collect data,"" she said. ""However, the cameras can only monitor wild animals and a few large bird species. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the area's avian life, bird surveys are essential. The success of the first Lancang bird-watching festival inspired us to incorporate a bird race into our project areas.""",,3252,chinadaily.com.cn,en

https://www.france24.com/en/france/20250704-should-france-s-incel-threat-be-treated-like-terrorism,Should France’s incel threat be treated like terrorism?,"An 18-year-old Frenchman was detained and charged on July 1 with being part of a terrorist criminal enterprise. Amid reports of an increase in masculinism – a belief in the supremacy of men and advocacy of outmoded gender roles – among young men, it is the first time that French anti-terror authorities have launched an investigation into someone for activities linked to the ""involuntary celibate” (incel) movement. France 's counter-terrorism authority has launched its first investigation into the threat posed by the toxic misogyny of masculinist, incel culture. An 18-year-old identified as Timothy G. was charged and placed in pre-trial detention on Tuesday for being part of a “terrorist criminal conspiracy” and making threats. He had two knives in his possession when he was arrested on June 28 in the Saint-Étienne region by the French domestic intelligence service, the DGSI, near the secondary school he attended. He had no police record and was enrolled in preparatory classes prior to attending university. Timothy G's lawyer, Maria Snitsar, said her client was “a young person in distress” who “has difficulty communicating with young people of his age [and] who is not at ease with himself”. She also said his detention was likely related to his activity online. “I have the impression that being on social networks played a part in his being placed under investigation.” Snitsar says understanding her client’s personality would be a key part of the inquiry. Determining the “legal categorisation of the charges” will be possible only once the investigation has progressed further, she added. Very little information has been made public since Timothy G.'s first appearance before a custodial judge. However, the National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor's Office confirmed that an investigation had been opened into the young man, who ""claims to be a member of the ‘incel’ movement"". Incels feel they have been rejected by women and have adopted aggressively misogynist views in response. According to a source close to the investigation, this is the first time an individual claiming to belong to this movement has been referred to the anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office for related activities. Since the creation of the special anti-terror prosecutor's office in 2019, magistrates have mainly focused on the jihadist threat or potential attacks from far-right groups. Watch more France arrests teen for plotting attacks on women in landmark 'incel' case “There isn't much case law on this type of issue,” notes Snitsar. But in recent years, the “incel” branch of the masculinist movement has stepped up its hateful rhetoric, sometimes leading to acts of violence. In May 2024, a 26-year-old man was arrested near Bordeaux after a member of the public alerted authorities to his toxic online posts via the interior ministry’s Pharos web portal , a system designed to curb illicit or harmful online content. He had posted a video praising “incel” Elliot Rodger, the 22-year-old perpetrator of a 2014 mass killing in Isla Vista, California , in which seven people died, including Rodger. Because the terrorist intentions of the young Frenchman from Bordeaux were not established, the anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office did not deal with the case. Originating in North America in the 1990s, masculinist ideology has taken off, in part thanks to the internet . France’s High Council for Equality between Women and Men (HCE) noted in its most recent report in January that ""sexist and masculinist discourse has gained in visibility"". ""Women are more feminist and men more masculinist, especially young people,"" notes the council’s director, Bérangère Couillard. According to a 2024 HCE survey , 52 percent of men between 25 and 34 felt that ""men are being picked on"". Among the various branches of masculinism popular on online forums, the ""incels"" are the most violent. A few hours before going on his killing spree, Rodger posted a long manifesto , justifying his actions by his hatred of women who had rejected him. “I do not know why you girls aren’t attracted to me,” he wrote “But I will punish you all for it.” Mélissa Blais, professor of sociology at the Université du Québec in Outaouais (UQO) and a specialist in antifeminist movements, says there is something particularly violent about the movements seen today. ""In ‘incel’ communities, there's something going on that's conducive to mass murder. Women are dehumanised, labelled as ‘femoids’ – seen as creatures to be fought. Dehumanisation is an important part of mass murder,"" Blais says. Canada has been one of the epicentres of masculinism since a 1989 massacre at Montreal 's École Polytechnique that targeted women. ""There were two charges of terrorism brought in connection with masculinist attacks in Canada in 2023,” says Blais. One of the two men involved was a minor who had attempted to murder women in a massage parlour in 2020 in a case also inspired by the incel movement. In that case, an Ontario judge explained during the hearing that the suspect's behaviour did, indeed, meet the criteria to be considered terrorism under the Canadian Criminal Code. Many countries are now weighing what incel activity meets the criteria to be legally categorised as terrorism. After a mass shooting in Plymouth in August 2021, UK counter-terrorism police initially felt the attack had not been motivated by ""incel"" propaganda . They backtracked in light of videos found on the suspect’s computer. ""The question is whether or not the authorities wish to treat the ‘incel’ phenomenon as a terrorist risk,"" notes the UK's independent terrorism laws auditor, Jonathan Hall. Hall says the definition of terrorism in the UK is broad enough to prosecute “incel” violence under its statutes. The incel threat is difficult for the police to track. Although all are young men, they do not function as an established group or have a hierarchy, unlike a structured terrorist organisation. They also come from a wide variety of social backgrounds.

However, a 2021 report by the Paris public prosecutor's office cited by Mediapart noted the ideological proximity between the radical far right and masculinist groups. In its 2020 report on the terrorist threat, the European police agency Europol categorised “incels” as a subset of “far-right terrorism”. But Eviane Leidig, a researcher at the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism, an independent think tank, says this classification does not provide an effective understanding of the threat. “Movements such as male supremacism and ‘incels’ can and should be considered as a distinct threat category, and not simply as a ‘gateway’ to other ideologies,” she says. The investigation into Timothy G. could provide the first clues as to how the French justice system will come to grips with the masculinist threat as well as the role of social networks in recruitment.
